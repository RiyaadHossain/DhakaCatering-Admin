        A hamburger, or simply burger, is a food consisting of fillings— usually
        a patty of ground meat, typically beef—placed inside a sliced bun or
        bread roll. Hamburgers are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato,
        onion, pickles, bacon, or chilis; condiments such as ketchup, mustard,
        mayonnaise, relish, or a "special sauce," often a variation of Thousand
        Island dressing; and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns.

        Food is one of the basic necessities of life. Food contains
        nutrients—substances essential for the growth, repair and for the
        regulation of vital processes. Nutrients provide the energy our bodies
        need to function.
